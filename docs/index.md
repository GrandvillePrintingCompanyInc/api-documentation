The GPC API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

You can use the GPC API in test mode, which doesn't affect your live data or interact with our presses.

The GPC API doesn't support bulk updates. You can work on only one object per request.

The GPC API differs for every account as we release new versions and tailor functionality. Log in to see docs customized to your version of the API, with your test key and data.
